### Hi! I'm [@narolski](https://github.com/narolski) (Paweł Narolski) 👋

Machine Learning Engineer based in Wrocław, Poland. 🇵🇱

I'm working on AI-based biometric recognition and identity document processing-based identity verification systems. 🕵️

I like to build things with Python, PyTorch, Kubernetes, and Golang. I've based most of my production-grade work on them. ⚒️

I'm currently leading the Research and Development Team at [@IDENTT](https://identt.io). My goal there is to deliver scalable, automated ways to improve our machine learning models in production. We do this by working with Kubeflow, FastAPI, Nvidia Triton, and ONNX. 👨‍🔬
